Maliit na Marupok na Puso by Victor Lundberg
In the corner of the crowded room
Your eyes meet mine
Conversations fill the air
Lost in space and time
I don't ask for your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near
Taking steps to keep my distance
I don't wanna fall
Am I strong enough to guide my puso
Away from it all?
I won't call your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near
Do we all so slowly lose control?
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown
Or do we all guard our small, fragile pusos?
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our pusos
Do we all so slowly lose control?
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown
Or do we all guard our small, fragile pusos?
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our pusos
