Maliit na Marupok na Puso by Victor Lundberg
In the corner of the crowded room
Your eyes meet mine (YIEEEE)
Conversations fill the air
Lost in space and time
I don't ask for your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm (yeahhh~)
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near
Taking steps to keep my distance
I don't wanna fall (no, no, nooOOoO)
Am I strong enough to guide my heart
Away from it all?
I won't call your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm (LET'S GET IT)
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near (OW!)
Do we all so slowly lose control? 
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown
Or do we all guard our small, fragile hearts? (YUH!)
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our hearts (ooooh~)
Do we all so slowly lose control?
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown (BRRRRRRR)
Or do we all guard our small, fragile hearts?
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our hearts (RATATA)
