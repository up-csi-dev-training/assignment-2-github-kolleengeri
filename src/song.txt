(German) Kleine Zerbrechliche Herzen by Victor Lundberg
(Tagalog) Maliit na Marupok na Puso by Victor Lundberg

In the corner of the crowded room
Your eyes meet mine (YIEEEE)
Conversations fill the air
Lost in space and time

###[Chorus]
I don't ask for your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm (yeahhh~)
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near

###[Verse 2]
Taking steps to keep my distance
I don't wanna fall (no, no, nooOOoO)
Am I strong enough to guide my puso
Away from it all?

###[Chorus]
I won't call your name
It's already carved in the air, mm-mm (LET'S GET IT)
I won't light the flame
It's already burning when you are near (OW!)

###[Bridge]
Do we all so slowly lose control?
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown
Or do we all guard our small, fragile pusos? (YUH!)
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our pusos (ooooh~)

###[Instrumental Break]

###[Outro]
Do we all so slowly lose control?
As emotions overflow
Falling into the unknown (BRRRRRRR)

Or do we all guard our small, fragile pusos?
As we're softly breaking apart
Afraid to give in to the start
And open up our pusos (RATATA)
