"The Way Things Go" - Beabadoobee

And there's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say "Love is blind"
But I guess that's the way things go

Can't remember how to say your name
Let alone count all the freckles on your face
A distant memory I used to know
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
Can't remember when you said you called
Miles away, and it was still my fault
The love you said you had, it sometime showed
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go

There's so much left to say
I guess I'm just the bigger guy
And there's too much on my mind
That I don't even want to try
Guess it's not far from the ordinary
They do say "Love is blind"
But I guess that's the way things go

Didn't think you'd ever stoop so low
Getting with the only girl you know
A lousy route that only makes me say "That's pretty lame"
And that's the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go

Passed your house when I was on a train
In my mind, you'll always stay the same
I'm happy now, I ought to let you know
But I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
And I don't mind that that's the way things go
And I don't mind, I don't mind

I don't mind, I don't mind
I don't mind, I don't mind
Oh, I guess that's just the way things go
Oh, I guess that's the way things go
