Pokemon Theme
TV version

I wanna be the very best
Like no one ever was
To catch them is my real test
To train them is my cause
I will travel across the land
Searching far and wide
Teach Pokémon to understand
The power that's inside

Pokémon 
(Gotta catch 'em all), it's you and me
I know it's my destiny
Oh, you're my best friend
In a world we must defend
Pokémon (Gotta catch 'em all), a heart so true
Our courage will pull us through
You teach me, and I'll teach you
Pokémon
Gotta catch 'em all!
Gotta catch 'em all!
Po-ké-mon!

"Pokémon Theme" was written by John Siegler and John Loeffler, and performed by Jason Paige.
This song served as the original theme for the first season of the English adaptation of the Pokémon anime.
Since then, its iconic line, "Gotta catch 'em all!" became the franchise's official English slogan.
